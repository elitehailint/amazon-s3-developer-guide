You have a few options in how to repair your hail damaged vehicle after it has been damaged. You can take it to a body shop, have it fixed by a professional hail repair company, or simply take it to your insurance company's recommended shop. Below, we will go over  each scenario. Choosing a Body Shop For A RepairMany body shops will sub out the work to fix the dance to a professional hail repair company. The reason why this is because technicians that are good at repairing dents and dings make a lot of money chasing storms. So when a storm hits an area, like San Antonio, a lot of professionals come from all over the United States to team up with body shops to do the work. Usually, body shops try to paint and buy new parts for your car because it is in their financial interest. The downside to this is that you are replacing what could be a repairable job with a new item that may not be OEM factory part, and not a factory page.If you want to use a body shop to repair your hail damage, we recommend elite collision repair. They have one of the nicest paint booths in San Antonio Texas and have a long history of working with customers. Choosing An Auto Hail Damage Repair CompanyThere are many benefits by using a company that specializes in fixing only hail damage. One advantage is that the repair process is done usually the fastest. They also repair the factory paint to where you cannot tell there was any damage. This allows you to keep the factory paint which tends to be cleaner than repainting a new piece. It also ensures that your car keeps using factory parts instead of aftermarket replacement parts, which most insurance companies use when they want to replace the part on your car.When using paintless dent repair company, most people do not realize that they get a lifetime warranty. So in the unlikely event that a debt returns, a reputable hail repair company's lifetime guarantee will remove the dent at no charge.not all professional hail repair companies are created equal. When choosing a professional hail repair company, it is best to find one that has been established and has a physical location with a real address that belongs to the business. The reason why that is many of these companies travel around the country. So when they are done in your city, they are off to the next. Some companies will then handle any dents of return by hiring another company locally, this is a great practice only done by the most reputable companies.one of the benefits of using a professional dent removal company, is that they usually have a generous deductible assistance program. For example, if your car sustained a lot of damage from hail, and your deductible is $500, often times the dent repair company will pay your deductible for you. Another benefit that is often passed down, is they provide rental cars. If you have rental car insurance in your plan, then you use that. However, if you don't have rental car protection, many hail repair companies will offer you a rental car at no charge. Many body shops do not offer these benefits, though it depends on each individual shop.                                                                                                            It is highly recommended to do your homework on any body shop or a repair company. A great way to know if they are reputable is to check their Google reviews. If they do not have very many reviews, it is likely that they are a temporary company trying to cash in on the hail damage. I would recommend using a company that has reviews dating back years to ensure that they are establishing reputable.  Elite Hail International is a  reputable company with over a decade of serving the San Antonio area. Letting Your Insurance Company DecideInsurance companies are in the business of making money, so they like to use body shops that are the cheapest. Most people do not know that it is your right to choose who prepares your vehicle. Oftentimes insurance companies will try to warn you for not using one of their companies, this is often a cost-saving tactic.
